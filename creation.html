        I consume a lot of content -- podcasts, blog posts, videos, and books from time to time. Even though most of what I consume is informative & beneficial
        for me, it doesn't leave me satisfied at the end of the day - in fact, it makes me depressed if I do it continuously.
      </p>
      <p>Ain't nothing is as satisfying as a good day of coding or writing or reflecting on what I learned with a friend.</p>
      <p>I have been contemplating methods of creation that bring me joy, so I came up with this list of things I enjoy creating:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Code - Writing a beautiful abstraction, refactoring something messy & chaotic to elegant & maintainable, coming up with a perfect name for a variable
        </li>
        <li>
          Blog posts - The whole process of coming up with an idea &rarr; Outlining what to write &rarr; Putting it all together &rarr;
          <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1521238735207116800">Rewriting</a>
        </li>
        <li>Explaining what I learned to a friend (sort of like a non-recorded podcast)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Perfection trap</h2>
      <p>
        When it came to writing, the only thing that used to stop me was seeking perfection. I wanted the site I post it in, the topic, and even the length of
        the post to be perfect - that also meant nothing gets posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built the simplest site without static site generators, and now I write whatever piques my interest at the given moment - this did the job of getting
        out of the trap!
