      <p>
        Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. You will be notified by Apple if
        the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, seek your consent to continue. You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start
        of the latest Paid Subscription period.

        Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before Apple
        starts charging your payment method, cancel the subscription no later than 24-hours before the free trial ends.
