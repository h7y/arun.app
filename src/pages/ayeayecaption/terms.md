### Apple Standard EULA

When Aye Aye Caption is downloaded from the App Store, the app is subject to [Appleâ€™s standard end user license agreement (EULA)](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/).

### Subscriptions

Aye Aye Caption requires a Paid Subscription for unlimited usage. Paid Subscriptions are managed by Apple; see [Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/) for the appropriate terms and conditions for your country.

Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings.
