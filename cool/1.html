        After 23 years of my life, I've learnt that I've been walking in a way that's not so good for my knees. Recently, I've been trying to get into the habit
        of walking after every meal, and I wanted to verify if I'm walking correctly. I came across this comprehensive video by Bob and Brad, which was
        eye-opening.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the video, they discuss <em>why walking with your heel touching the ground first is a bad idea</em> and how to fix it. They also have great charisma!

      <h2><a href="https://sive.rs/srs">Spaced repetition</a></h2>
      <p>
        I've heard of this concept somewhere before, but recently I rediscovered it again after someone brought it up in the
        <a href="/derek">meetup with Derek</a>. It's a learning technique where you review whatever you want to learn at increasingly longer intervals,
        typically with the help of an app like <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Derek does a great job of explaining it in his article. I'm super excited to try this out!</p>

        Sometimes I try watching movies/shows without subtitles and constantly feel like I'm mishearing or missing out on the dialogues. This video was an
        insightful watch that explained the issue effectively, and it was reassuring to see I'm not the only one facing this problem.
