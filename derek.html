      <h1>Meeting Derek Sivers</h1>

        It was Feb 7, 2023 - I was going through my emails & clearing out the junk. Suddenly an email caught my attention - it was from Derek, titled "Who
        should I meet in Chennai and Bengaluru?" (<a href="https://sive.rs/meet-chbg">Derek's announcement</a>)
      </p>
      <p>I got so excited seeing this and immediately started composing a response.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Hey Derek,</p>

        <p>
          Loved listening to your episode on the Remote Ruby podcast. I'm a big fan of the way you approach things! I'm a 23 y/o developer from Chennai,
          currently working at Unifize (communication platform for manufacturing companies). I love to talk tech and indie hack projects. You can find more
          about me on <a href="/">my site</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Usually, when people visit India, they rarely come to Chennai. I was attending a meeting when I saw your email. Instantly it got me on the edge of my
          seat to compose this reply.
        </p>

        <p>I could also help you in finding fun places to hang out! Didn't expect your son to be half Tamil. Would love to meet him as well ðŸ¤©</p>

        <p>Cheers, <br />Arun</p>

      <p>28 mins pass by... and Derek responds!</p>
      <p>He replied with a link, which is a simple tiny app made by Derek for this meetup, where I could RSVP.</p>
      <p>
        Finally, the day came, and we (I and <a href="https://anumitha.com">Anumitha</a>) met him. It was great seeing people from various backgrounds and
        cities travelling down to see a person because they found what he wrote inspiring, transformative & profound. Wherever he goes in this world, he will
        attract a similar, if not larger, crowd. It shows <b>the power of writing</b>. Derek is truly a citizen of the world!
      </p>
      <p>This meetup and <a href="https://sive.rs/local">this article</a> by Derek inspired me to start writing again. Here's to more posts ðŸ¥‚</p>
